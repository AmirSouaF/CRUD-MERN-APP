# CRUD-MERN-APP
CRUD App
This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app that allows users to manage and manipulate data. It is built using React, Express.js, and MongoDB.

Getting Started
  To use this app, you will need to install Node.js and MongoDB on your local machine.
  You will also need to create a new MongoDB database and update the config.js file with your database credentials.

    Features
      Create new data
      Read existing data
      Update existing data
      Delete data
    
    Installation
      Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
        Install dependencies:
          In the client directory, run npm install
          In the server directory, run npm install
        Run the app:
          In the client directory, run npm start
          In the server directory, run npm start


    Acknowledgments
      The React team for creating a great front-end library
      The Express.js team for creating a powerful back-end framework
      The MongoDB team for creating a scalable NoSQL database system


The application can be accessed in a web browser at http://localhost:3000. The server-side API code is in server.js, and the client-side React code is in the client directory.


This application is a good starting point for building more complex full-stack web applications.
